# Unit Test Task 3: Add Process Management Tests

## Priority: MEDIUM - Implement Soon

## Description

Add comprehensive tests for process management functionality including timeouts, spawning errors, and cleanup procedures.

## Scope

- Test command timeout functionality
- Test process spawn error handling
- Test child process cleanup on server shutdown
- Test process lifecycle management

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/processManagement.test.ts` (new file)
- May need to update existing process-related utilities

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tests verify proper handling of command timeouts
2. Tests validate graceful handling of process spawn errors
3. Tests ensure proper cleanup of child processes
4. Tests cover process termination scenarios
5. All tests pass consistently

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// tests/processManagement.test.ts
describe('Process Management', () => {
  test('should terminate process on timeout', async () => {
    // Test command timeout functionality
  });
  
  test('should handle process spawn errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Test error handling when shell cannot be spawned
  });
  
  test('should properly clean up child processes', async () => {
    // Test cleanup on server shutdown
  });
});
```

- Mock child_process spawn and exec functions
- Test timeout scenarios with actual timing validation
- Verify error propagation from failed process starts
- Test cleanup behavior during server shutdown

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Task 1 (ES Module fixes) and Task 2 (Test Helpers)
- **Independent of**: Tasks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (can be implemented in parallel)

## Notes

Process management is critical for security and stability, so thorough testing is essential.
