# Unit Test Task 4: Add Async Operation Tests

## Priority: MEDIUM - Implement Soon

## Description

Create tests for asynchronous command execution scenarios including concurrent operations and command queueing behavior.

## Scope

- Test concurrent command execution handling
- Test command queueing when limits are reached
- Test async operation error handling
- Test race condition scenarios

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/asyncOperations.test.ts` (new file)
- May need updates to async utility functions

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tests verify proper handling of multiple simultaneous commands
2. Tests validate command queueing behavior under load
3. Tests ensure async operations don't interfere with each other
4. Tests cover async error scenarios
5. Race condition edge cases are tested

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// tests/asyncOperations.test.ts
describe('Async Command Execution', () => {
  test('should handle concurrent command executions', async () => {
    // Test multiple simultaneous commands
  });
  
  test('should queue commands when limit reached', async () => {
    // Test command queueing behavior
  });
});
```

- Use Promise.all() and Promise.race() in test scenarios
- Mock async operations with controlled timing
- Test command concurrency limits
- Verify proper async error propagation

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Task 1 (ES Module fixes) and Task 2 (Test Helpers)
- **Independent of**: Tasks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (can be implemented in parallel)

## Notes

Async behavior is complex and prone to race conditions, making thorough testing crucial.
