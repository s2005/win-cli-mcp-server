# Unit Test Task 8: Add Performance Tests

## Priority: LOW - Nice to Have

## Description

Create performance tests to ensure the system handles large outputs, concurrent operations, and resource-intensive scenarios efficiently.

## Scope

- Test handling of large command outputs (1MB+)
- Test concurrent command execution performance
- Test memory usage and cleanup
- Test response time under various loads

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/performance.test.ts` (new file)
- May need performance testing utilities

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Large output handling completes within acceptable time limits
2. Memory usage remains reasonable under load
3. Concurrent operations don't degrade performance excessively
4. Response times are measured and validated
5. Performance tests are reliable and repeatable

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// tests/performance.test.ts
describe('Performance', () => {
  test('should handle large command outputs efficiently', async () => {
    const largeOutput = 'x'.repeat(1024 * 1024); // 1MB
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    // Test command that generates large output
    const result = await executeCommand('echo ' + largeOutput);
    
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(5000); // Should complete within 5 seconds
  });
});
```

- Generate large test outputs for performance validation
- Use performance timing APIs for accurate measurements
- Test memory usage patterns with different scenarios
- Create baseline performance expectations

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Task 1 (ES Module fixes) and Task 2 (Test Helpers)
- **Independent of**: All other tasks (can be implemented in parallel)

## Notes

Performance tests help ensure the system scales appropriately and doesn't have memory leaks or performance regressions.
