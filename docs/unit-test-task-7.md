# Unit Test Task 7: Add Integration Tests

## Priority: MEDIUM - Implement Soon  

## Description

Create end-to-end integration tests that validate complete workflows and interactions between different components of the system.

## Scope

- Create end-to-end command execution tests
- Test complete MCP protocol interactions
- Test shell isolation and security boundaries
- Test configuration loading and application

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/integration/` directory (new)
- `tests/integration/endToEnd.test.ts` (new file)
- `tests/integration/mcpProtocol.test.ts` (new file)
- `tests/integration/shellExecution.test.ts` (new file)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. End-to-end PowerShell script execution works correctly
2. Command isolation and security boundaries are validated
3. MCP protocol message handling is tested completely
4. Integration with different shell types is verified
5. Configuration changes affect behavior as expected

## Implementation Details

- Create TestCLIServer for integration testing
- Test actual command execution with controlled environments
- Verify security restrictions work in real scenarios  
- Test protocol message serialization/deserialization

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Task 1 (ES Module fixes) and Task 2 (Test Helpers)
- **Benefits from**: Task 9 (Test Data Fixtures) for standardized test data
- **Independent of**: Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (can be implemented in parallel)

## Notes

Integration tests are crucial for validating that all components work together correctly in realistic scenarios.
