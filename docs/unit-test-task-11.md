# Unit Test Task 11: Reorganize Test Structure

## Priority: LOW - Nice to Have

## Description

Reorganize the test file structure to improve maintainability and logical grouping of related tests.

## Scope

- Split large test files into focused modules
- Create logical directory structure for tests
- Group related tests by functionality
- Improve test discoverability and navigation

## Files to Modify/Create

- Restructure `tests/` directory with new organization
- Create `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/helpers/`, `tests/fixtures/` directories
- Move and split existing test files appropriately

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tests are logically grouped by functionality
2. Large test files are split into manageable modules
3. Directory structure is intuitive and navigable
4. All tests continue to run after reorganization
5. Import paths are updated correctly

## Implementation Details

- Create unit/validation/, unit/config/, unit/wsl/ subdirectories
- Split large test files like validation.test.ts into focused modules
- Update import paths and Jest configuration as needed
- Ensure test discovery still works correctly

## Dependencies

- **Should be done after**: All other tasks (Tasks 1-10) to avoid merge conflicts
- **Requires**: Coordination with other test improvements

## Notes

This reorganization should be done last to avoid conflicts with other test improvements and to ensure all new tests are included in the restructure.
