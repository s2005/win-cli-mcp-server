# Unit Test Task 1: Fix ES Module Compilation Issues

## Priority: HIGH - Fix Immediately

## Description

Tests that import `CLIServer` from `src/index.js` fail with 193-second timeouts due to ES module compilation problems. This is blocking other tests from running properly.

## Scope

- Fix ES module import issues in existing tests
- Create MockCLIServer helper to avoid direct ES module dependencies
- Ensure all tests can run without compilation errors

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/helpers/MockCLIServer.ts` (new file)
- Update any test files that import from `src/index.js`
- Review and fix Jest configuration if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All existing tests pass without timeout errors
2. MockCLIServer provides necessary functionality for testing
3. ES module imports work correctly in test environment
4. Test execution time is reduced to reasonable levels (<30 seconds for full suite)

## Implementation Details

- Create MockCLIServer class that implements required functionality without ES module dependencies
- Replace direct imports from `src/index.js` with mock implementations
- Validate that validateCommand and validateWorkingDirectory functions are properly accessible
- Ensure mock server maintains same interface as actual CLIServer

## Dependencies

- **Blocks**: All other test improvement tasks
- **Requires**: None (foundation task)

## Notes

This is the most critical task as it's blocking the entire test suite from running reliably.
