[MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for secure command-line interactions on Windows systems, enabling controlled access to PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash shells.
It allows MCP clients (like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) to perform operations on your system, similar to [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This MCP server provides direct access to your system's command line interface. When enabled, it grants access to your files, environment variables, and command execution capabilities.
>
> - Review and restrict allowed paths
> - Enable directory restrictions
> - Configure command blocks
> - Consider security implications
>
> See [Configuration](#configuration) for more details.

- **Resource Exposure**: View current directory and configuration as MCP resources
- **Security Controls**:
  - Command blocking (full paths, case variations)
  - Working directory validation
  - Maximum command length limits
  - Smart argument validation
- **Configurable**:
  - Custom security rules
  - Shell-specific settings
  - Path restrictions
  - Blocked command lists

See the [API](#api) section for more details on the tools and resources the server provides to MCP clients.

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within configured directories, with allowed commands.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@simonb97/server-win-cli"]
    }
  }
}
```

For use with a specific config file, add the `--config` flag:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@simonb97/server-win-cli",
        "--config",
        "path/to/your/config.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After configuring, you can:

- Execute commands directly using the available tools
- View server configuration in the Resources section

## Configuration

The server uses a JSON configuration file to customize its behavior. You can specify settings for security controls and shell configurations.

1. To create a default config file, either:

    **a)** copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` (or the location specified by `--config`), or

    **b)** run:

    ```bash
    npx @simonb97/server-win-cli --init-config ./config.json
    ```

2. Then set the `--config` flag to point to your config file as described in the [Usage with Claude Desktop](#usage-with-claude-desktop) section.

### Configuration Locations

The server looks for configuration in the following locations (in order):

1. Path specified by `--config` flag
2. ./config.json in current directory
3. ~/.win-cli-mcp/config.json in user's home directory

If no configuration file is found, the server will use a default (restricted) configuration:

### Default Configuration

**Note**: The default configuration is designed to be restrictive and secure. Find more details on each setting in the [Configuration Settings](#configuration-settings) section.

```json
{
  "security": {
    "maxCommandLength": 2000,
    "blockedCommands": [
      "rm",
      "del",
      "rmdir",
      "format",

      "netsh",
      "takeown",
      "icacls"
    ],
    "blockedArguments": [
      "--exec",
      "-e",
      "/c",
      "-enc",
      "-encodedcommand",
      "-command",
      "--interactive",
      "-i",
      "--login",
      "--system"
    ],
    "allowedPaths": ["User's home directory", "Current working directory"],
    "restrictWorkingDirectory": true,
    "commandTimeout": 30,
    "enableInjectionProtection": true
  },
  "shells": {
    "powershell": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "powershell.exe",
      "args": ["-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-Command"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]
    },
    "cmd": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/c"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]
    },
    "gitbash": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
      "args": ["-c"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Settings

The configuration file is divided into two main sections: `security` and `shells`.

#### Security Settings

```json
{
  "security": {
    // Maximum allowed length for any command
    "maxCommandLength": 1000,

    // Commands to block - blocks both direct use and full paths
    // Example: "rm" blocks both "rm" and "C:\Windows\System32\rm.exe"
    // Case-insensitive: "del" blocks "DEL.EXE", "del.cmd", etc.
    "blockedCommands": [
      "rm", // Delete files
      "del", // Delete files
      "rmdir", // Delete directories
      "format", // Format disks
      "shutdown", // Shutdown system
      "restart", // Restart system
      "reg", // Registry editor
      "regedit", // Registry editor
      "net", // Network commands
      "netsh", // Network commands
      "takeown", // Take ownership of files
      "icacls" // Change file permissions
    ],

    // Arguments that will be blocked when used with any command
    // Note: Checks each argument independently - "cd warm_dir" won't be blocked just because "rm" is in blockedCommands
    "blockedArguments": [
      "--exec", // Execution flags
      "-e", // Short execution flags
      "/c", // Command execution in some shells
      "-enc", // PowerShell encoded commands
      "-encodedcommand", // PowerShell encoded commands
      "-command", // Direct PowerShell command execution
      "--interactive", // Interactive mode which might bypass restrictions
      "-i", // Short form of interactive
      "--login", // Login shells might have different permissions
      "--system" // System level operations
    ],

    // List of directories where commands can be executed
    "allowedPaths": ["C:\\Users\\YourUsername", "C:\\Projects"],

    // If true, commands can only run in allowedPaths
    "restrictWorkingDirectory": true,

    // Timeout for command execution in seconds (default: 30)
    "commandTimeout": 30,

    // Enable or disable protection against command injection (covers ;, &, |, `)
    "enableInjectionProtection": true
  }
}
```

#### Shell Configuration

```json
{
  "shells": {
    "powershell": {
      // Enable/disable this shell
      "enabled": true,
      // Path to shell executable
      "command": "powershell.exe",
      // Default arguments for the shell
      "args": ["-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-Command"],
      // Optional: Specify which command operators to block
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]  // Block all command chaining
    },
    "cmd": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/c"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]  // Block all command chaining
    },
    "gitbash": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
      "args": ["-c"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]  // Block all command chaining
    }
  }
}
```


#### Chained Commands

You can execute a series of commands in one request by joining them with `&&`. The server validates each step and checks any `cd` operations against the allowed directories.

```json
{
  "name": "execute_command",
  "arguments": {
    "shell": "gitbash",
    "command": "cd /c/my/project && source venv/bin/activate && npm test"
  }
}
```

### Resources

- **cli://config**
  - Returns the main CLI server configuration (excluding sensitive data like blocked command details if security requires it).

## Security Considerations

This server allows external tools to execute commands on your system. Exercise extreme caution when configuring and using it.

### Built-in Security Features

- **Path Restrictions**: Commands can only be executed in specified directories (`allowedPaths`) if `restrictWorkingDirectory` is true.
- **Command Blocking**: Defined commands and arguments are blocked to prevent potentially dangerous operations (`blockedCommands`, `blockedArguments`).
- **Injection Protection**: Common shell injection characters (`;`, `&`, `|`, `` ` ``) are blocked in command strings if `enableInjectionProtection` is true.
- **Timeout**: Commands are terminated if they exceed the configured timeout (`commandTimeout`).
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated before execution
- **Shell process management**: Processes are properly terminated after execution or timeout

### Configurable Security Features (Active by Default)

- **Working Directory Restriction (`restrictWorkingDirectory`)**: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Limits command execution to safe directories.
- **Injection Protection (`enableInjectionProtection`)**: Recommended to prevent bypassing security rules.

### Best Practices

- **Minimal Allowed Paths**: Only allow execution in necessary directories.
- **Restrictive Blocklists**: Block any potentially harmful commands or arguments.
- **Regularly Review Logs**: Check the command history for suspicious activity.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure Node.js, npm, and the server itself are up-to-date.
